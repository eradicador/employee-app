# Employee Managament Directory

## Description
As a developer I created an employee directory with React library, the app will allow users to view the entire employee directory at once in a table with all of the employees information. Also the app will let users filter employees by name. The application's UI is divided into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
